\#Problem 2

Read in and tidy the data

``` r
tidy_df =
  names_df |> 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(files, ".csv", ""),
    arm = str_sub(files, 1, 3),
    ID = str_sub(files, 5, 7)) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "observation",
    names_prefix = "week_") |> 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) |> 
  select(arm, ID, week, observation)
```

Spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
tidy_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~arm) +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Observations", title = "Observations on Subjects over Time")
```
