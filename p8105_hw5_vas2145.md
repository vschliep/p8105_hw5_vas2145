\#Problem 2

Read in and tidy the data

``` r
tidy_df =
  names_df |> 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(files, ".csv", ""),
    arm = str_sub(files, 1, 3),
    ID = str_sub(files, 5, 7)) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "observation",
    names_prefix = "week_") |> 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) |> 
  select(arm, ID, week, observation)
```

Spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
tidy_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~arm) +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Observations", title = "Observations on Subjects over Time")
```

The `tidy_df` output depicts observations on subjects over time, from
the control group and the experimental group. Although Observed data
points in the control group were generally similar to the observed data
points in the experimental group at the start of the study, observed
data points increased over time in comparsion to the control group.
